    "No, I don't believe I have. That sounds like a good one, though . I've heard of the Zodiac killer.",

    "I dont really know much off the top of my head about fantasy serial killers. But have you seen The Cabin in the Woods Its a horror movie about a killer and they have to find out who is the killer",
