The movie follows the story of Buddy, a human raised as an elf at the North Pole, who goes to New York City in search of his true identity. The film is packed with hilarious fish-out-of-water humor as Buddy navigates the unfamiliar city and its customs. It also delivers heartwarming moments as Buddy spreads joy and Christmas spirit, and while the movie may not have intense thought-provoking drama, it does explore themes of family, belonging, and the magic of the holiday season in a lighthearted and touching way.",
