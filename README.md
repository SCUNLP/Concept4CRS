# CONCEPT â€“ An Evaluation Protocol on Conversation Recommender Systems with System-centric and User-centric Factors
> **Contact**: Chen Huang (Sichuan University)

- We propose an comprehesive conversational recommender system (CRS) evaluation protocol, called **Concept**. It considers both system- and user-centric factors and conceptualizes them into three characteristics, which are further divided into six primary abilities. 

- We have released the dataset, created by utilizing **Concept**, publicly to aid the research community in making advancements in CRS. A total of 6720 conversation data is recorded to collect the interactions between off-the-shelf CRS and simulated users who demonstrate different personas and preferences. 

- Our paper evaluate and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of off-the-shelf CRS models.

## Dataset Information
The folder `dataset/dialog_data` contains conversation data of 4 off-the-shelf CRS models (i.e., KBRD, BARCOR, UNICRS, CHATCRS). Each conversation data is in json format. Additionally, our data metadata is based on [This Git Repository](https://github.com/txy77/iEvaLM-CRS)
